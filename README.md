Prediciting the band limited RMS seismic ground motion from past and external data

## LIGO Ground motion prediction
* high noise in the 0.03-0.1 and 0.1-0.3 Hz band is often correlated with bad performance of the LIGO interferometers
* it would be useful to be able to predict the seismic motion several days in advance for purposes of planning work
* Maybe some ML can help

## Data Sources
1. LIGO Seismic BLRMS - need to release more of this
2. Bouy data
3. Some wind data from the region
4. Satellite data


## Data Access
* Can we release enough seismic BLRMS to crowd source?
* How to release enough BLRMS to make this an open data challenge?
